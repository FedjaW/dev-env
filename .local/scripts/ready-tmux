# what this is for: every folder can define an own ready-tmux.sh script to customize a specific tmux layout/setup
# 		    and in the $HOME dir a default tmux layout/setup can be defined

# this script needs to be in the $PATH env so that is executable from anywhere on the machine
# this is done via the dev-env.sh script by this line <copy_dir .local $HOME/.local>
# and .local is in my PATH because of the .zshrc configuration
# and it must be executable: <chmod +x ready-tmux>


# -x means is it executable?
