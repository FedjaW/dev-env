# Todo

- [ ] print out the files that are not executable and how to make them executable (chmo +x <filename>)

- [ ] need to have my .zshrc in the .config folder but it has to copy it to $HOME not into $HOME/.config (i think)

```config
# primes crazy tmux super scripterino
export PATH=$HOME/.local/scripts:$PATH
```config

- [ ] need to have this in my .zshrc (is put there by fzf if I allow at installation)

```config
## All that sweet sweet fzf
[ -f ~/.fzf.zsh ] && source ~/.fzf.zsh
```
